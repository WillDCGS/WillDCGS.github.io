    <td>The code in this part of Codecademy was really hard, so I had to use hints and if I didn't I would complete it to the best of my ability. As the sessions get completed, you move on to much harder python, this section was an example of very hard python. So in order to complete them I used the hints and solutions.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think because it got harder I started taking longer and not learning as much because they got harder so i couldn’t understand. I thought that I could have learnt more if I talked less. Some of my bad habits are talking and giving up too soon.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I focus and will not get distracted by my other classmates and their work. I will try and talk a lot less and I will try and get through many, many more exercises.</td>
