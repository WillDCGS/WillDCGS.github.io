  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using the slides on how to set up github and how to use Code Academy. I also learnt by asking my classmates. I found that rather than just asking and not learning anything it was better to figure it out for yourselfThe hints in code Academy really helped me as when I was stuck it would tell me what to do by giving me hints. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that talking limited my learning as if I did not talk I would have got further. Also I had never done python before so I will try to learn more python at home, also I need to stop asking people what to do and at least try to work it out for myself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will push myself superhard and not speak to my peers as muchI will try to use multitasking to make my working more efficient,  by having all of the tabs I need open and on separate windows. </td>
