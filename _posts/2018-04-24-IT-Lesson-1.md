  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using the slides on how to set up github and how to use Code Academy. I also learnt by asking my classmates. I found that rather than just asking and not learning anything it was better to figure it out for yourself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that talking limited my learning as if I did not talk I would have got further. Also I had never done python before so I will try to learn more python at home </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time I will push myself superhard and not speak to my peers as much.</td>
