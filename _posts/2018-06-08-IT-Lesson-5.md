  <tr>
    <td>As usual I used the hints where necessary as Boolean was quite complex(in my opinion). Instead of asking the teacher I made sure I asked my peers before pleading for help. I found that by taking your time on the harder questions made them a lot easier to understand and process.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning was talking, this is because I did not get as much done as I could have if I did not talk. Apart from this, I do not feel that there was Anything else that I needed to work on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will push myself superhard and not speak to my classmates as much. I will try to use multitasking to make my working more efficient,  by having all of the tabs I need open and on separate windows. I will also look up things that i do not understand.</td>
