    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by moving myself so that i would not get distracted, also i used split screen so that i can search up what something is if i do not know how to do something. I also used the solutions as it was quite hard so i was unable to do ir.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the fact that we had a supply teacher limited my learning because everyone was a bit unfocused because when you have a supply teacher people do not focus asmuch. I thought that I could have learnt more if I talked less. Some of my bad habits are talking and giving up too soon.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson we had a cover which meant we were less focused. Next time I will make sure that I focus and will not get distracted by my other classmates and their work. I will try and talk a lot less and I will try and get through many, many more exercises. </td>
