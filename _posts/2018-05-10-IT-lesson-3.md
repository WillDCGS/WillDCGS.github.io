    <td>The code in this part of Codecademy was really hard, so I had to use hints and if I didn't I would complete it to the best of my ability. I made sure that I got everything correct and only using the solutions when I really needed to. This method really helped and I will use it again next week.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the fact that we had a supply teacher limited my learning because everyone was a bit unfocused because when you have a supply teacher people do not focus asmuch. I thought that I could have learnt more if I talked less. Some of my bad habits are talking and giving up too soon.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I focus and will not get distracted by my other classmates and their work. I will try and talk a lot less and I will try and get through many, many more exercises.</td>
