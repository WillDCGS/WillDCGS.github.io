    <td>Boolean was really hard so i had to use methods of trial and improvement( as suggested by Mr Keen).  I also had to use hints and if I didn't I would complete it to the best of my ability. I made sure that I got everything correct and only using the solutions when I really needed to. This method really helped and I will use it again next week.</td>
